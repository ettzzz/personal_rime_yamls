copy all yaml files into :

- Windows: `~\AppData\Roaming\Rime` # weasel.custom.yaml works
- Mac: `~/Library/Rime` # squirrel.custom.yaml works
- Linux: `~/.config/fcitx/rime`, # this is for fcitx 4.x.x in ubuntu 20.04

tip: on debian/ubuntu you need to first run `sudo apt-get install fcitx-rime` and configure it manually in system settings, NOTE: appearance cannot be set by rime's way, needs to setup in fcitx GUI's Appearance. Check out those fcitx skin collections on github
